The Silver Hammer Software Library (shslib.a) contains general purpose 
functions for C programs.  Some of these could be incorporated in gcc, IMHO.

The funtions in NullSafeFuncs.c were concieved when the C language powers-that-be
decreed that fclose () and the string functions with a null pointer arguments
should throw segmentation faults and terminate program execution.
